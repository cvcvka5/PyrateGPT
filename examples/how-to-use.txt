Run debug.py

it will launch a window then go to chatgpt.

you must login to your google account then to your chatgpt account. (it will be saved)

then whenever it launches you must go to a random chat from the sidebar and press enter on the terminal to continue,

or just pass in the custom chat link in the config.json

then thats it (you should use the init prompt)
