Respond only in the chat window without pop-ups or additional lines.
Respond as if you're sending me a direct message on WhatsApp, so don't use any ChatGPT exclusive features,
such as pop-ups, bold formats, italic formats, html elements, etc.
Just respond as a direct normal chat message. Okay?
Keep your messages short, NEVER OPEN A POPUP, SEND MESSAGES AS IF WE'RE CHATTING IN WHATSAPP ONLY THROUGH THE CHAT.
